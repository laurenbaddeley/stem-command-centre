As we continue to grow and expand, we have decided to move into new office space. We are beyond excited for this move, as our new building is in a much better location to travel to, as well as having parking spaces for everyone!

We have a large open place space, for people to work collaboratively together.

We also have some new meeting rooms which is great. Our last office space didn't have enough of these and we were always scrambling to get a room booked before anyone else.

Hopefully this new office space will last us for a few years before needing to move again!
