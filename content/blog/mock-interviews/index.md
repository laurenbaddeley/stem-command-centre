As part of our ongoing strategy to address skills shortages within the industry, ACME Corporation are engaging more with local schools and getting involved in events such as their Year 10 Mock Interview Skills Day.

The day involved representatives from local businesses interviewing the students on general topics, in order to give the students practice in answering the sorts of questions they could face in the next few years. For some students, this was their first experience of a formal interview with external employers and so provided a great opportunity for constructive feedback, tips on how to present themselves to a future employer, and also an opportunity to show them that interviews aren’t as daunting as they might think.

ACME Corporation had a great time talking with several bright and enthusiastic students, some of whom are thinking about working in the tech industry. This gave us a unique chance to have a one-to-one conversation about what we do on a daily basis at ACME Corporation, what we look for in a potential candidate, and it allowed the students to ask us lots of questions that they had about the industry. Although it was only a brief time spent with the students, we believe experiences like this can have a huge impact on a students outlook as sometimes all it takes is one conversation to spark an interest.

The Careers Coordinator who organised the event followed up with some great feedback on how the day went: 
> “Just to say thank you so much for the time you gave our students yesterday. I was genuinely touched by your sincerity, warmth and genuine desire to help our young people. 

> Please do not underestimate the impact that you have had on our students as they begin to consider their futures. For most this was their first formal encounter with an employer. These students are now in a fortunate position to be able to reflect on the feedback you have given them. I know they will be able to put some of the skills they have learnt into practice as their confidence grows and they start to experience the working world.”

ACME Corporation look forward to the next mock interview skills session which will take place around November time.
