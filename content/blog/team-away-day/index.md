To thank our employees and give them a great day out, we decided to have a Team Away day at the local go karting race track. It was an absolutely fantastic day - the sun was shining, the music was playing and everyone had a great day racing each other. 

We each had some practice laps and then we split into teams of 4 for an endurance race. It was fast, exciting and I wish we could go back and do it again. Team Mario won the race and got a box of chocolates as their prize.

After the race, we then had a BBQ in the park nearby. Burgers, sausages, lamb, roasted red peppers - you name it, we had all the food you could want at our BBQ. It was absolutely delicious and a big shout out to the chef.
